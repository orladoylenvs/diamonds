Let's plot the diamonds dataset using ggplot2.

#load libraries
library(ggplot2)
```

Let's take a quick look at the data.

head(diamonds)
```

View the diamonds dataset as counts by ::: {.callout}
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
   aes(x = cut, y = price))+
geom_histogram( stat = "identity")
```

Let's log the date and time.
